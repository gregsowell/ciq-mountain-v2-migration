# example of a fully qualified domain host
webhost12.gregsowell.com

#example of a non FQDN host
#add the ansible_host variable to specify what IP address ansible should use to connect
webhost44 ansible_host=192.168.1.44

#example of using IP ranges
#this will attempt to connect to all hosts from 10.134.10.0 to 10.134.11.254
#this is a quick and dirty way to pull in a lot of hosts at once
10.134.1[0:1].[1:254]

#hereâ€™s an example of doing the same thing via hostnames
#This would be webserver001.gregsowell.com to webserver254.gregsowell.com
webserver[001:254].gregsowell.com
